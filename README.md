# Data Scraping with NLP Preprocessing
## Introduction
This project focuses on data scraping using Selenium and preprocessing the data using NLP techniques. The scraped data is tokenized using NLTK and stop words are removed for further analysis.

# Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following packages installed

1. Selenium

2. NLTK

3. Pandas

## Usage

Clone the repository code:: git clone https://github.com/abdulrehman1232/Data-scrapping-using-Python.git

## Results

The scraped data will be saved in a CSV file and the preprocessed data will be saved in a separate CSV file. You can then use this data for further analysis or modeling.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to scrape data using Selenium and preprocess the data using NLP techniques. The results show that this approach can be used to gather and clean data effectively.
